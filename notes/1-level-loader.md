# Feature: Level Selector/Loader

Right now the game only supports one level (the one in levels.ts)
Now implement a level selector/loader to 

- [ ] read all levels (`.ts` file) in `app/levels` and dynamically load them into the game (use filename as level name)
- [ ] in the main page, use a dropdown menu to choose from different levels to play
